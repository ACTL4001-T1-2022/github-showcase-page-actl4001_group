Executive Summary
======================

The report presents how we plan to help the Commissioner of Sport for Rarita build the national football team as well as provide detail to its competitiveness and positive impact on the economy. The team selection and implementation plan is set out by an Actuarial control and business cycle plan. The metrics used for assessment and the impact described in the economy are highlighted and continuously monitored the results to identify and define new problems uncovered in our analysis.

The report summarises the two team competitiveness objectives and thoroughly outlines the actuarial and business implementation plan used for the team and economic evaluation respectively. The assumptions and limitations that come from the judgement of the team selection and its impact on the economy are summarised to present the constraint and unresolved constraints. 


Objectives
======================

The aim of the report was to help the country of Rarita select a team of players who will build a brand for Rarita’s football program with the goal to achieve a positive economic impact. The Commissioner of Sport for Rarita aims the team to be competitive, meaning that both the team ranks in the top 10 within the next five years. As well as achieving a FSA championship within the next ten years both with a high probability. The two objectives were assessed in the report and are summarised below:

 - The following team is projected to have an average chance 85.32% of achieving in the top 10 of the tournament within the next five years. The team’s chance of achieving in the top ten is most likely to occur in year five of them being together, with a probability of 88.74%.
 - The team also on 35.08% average have a probability of ever winning the championship in the next ten years. This estimate is mostly likely to occur in seven years times, which gives them a chance of 43.05% of occur with a standard deviation  3.46%.




Team Selection
======================

We derived a performance metric across all players using the historical data of 2020 and 2021 tournament results. This performance metric was a calculation using the weighted average of the team’s performance whilst also incorporating the effectiveness of each player’s position on the field. The overall model is constructed from the work, Money Talks: Team Variables and Player Positions that Most Influence the Market Value of Professional Male Footballers in Europe by six academics primarily from the University of Madrid: José Luis Felipe, Alvaro Fernandez-Luna and Pablo Burillo. The team selection was constructed on the foundation set in the paper but selecting each player by each position. The team constructed for the country of Rarita was modeled using a generalized linear model in order to understand the predictors which compose a strong player for each position .  The team formation is 4-4-2, meaning there will be four defenders, four midfielders and two forwards.
 
After the four generalized linear models are performed in best predicting our performance metric. The players I ranked from best to worst according to the player’s predicted score. It is clear from the figure below why the models agree that a player aged 20-25 is best to be selected due to their performance being at peak at around age 27. Moreover, the figure below shows that the salary and performance are not correlated, primarily due to the non-linear relationship between salary and score. Hence, it is financially efficient to select younger players who have salaries that are lower.

  </p>

The graph above should be the red and blue lines for the 2020 and 2021 tournament performances. The performance for each position is predicted by incorporating the logistic linking function to maximize the person’s probability of achieving a championship.
Once the players are ranked according to the performance metric predicted. The salary for each player is too expensive for the 995,000,000 budgets. Hence, national Rarita players are considered more highly and reassessed under each player’s performance divided by their annual salary. Therefore, when considering the budget constraint, the models recommend selecting a Rarita player of much more worth since these players have a 74.32% lower salary on average but perform at 40.32% as well according to the developed scoring metric. Resulting, in the player being much more worth their salary. Once all the players are ranked there are only three selected  players who are not from Rarita. 
This is because after appropriately integrating their salary to adjust their ranking. A new problem was found that certain players are far too expensive for their worth.  This resulted in two midfielders and a defender to be replaced by player’s who are more worth their salary with respect to their replaced players.
The replaced players’ salaries are quite expensive with respect to the Rarita’s player respectively.. However, the replacement will lead to a 34.52 percentage point increase in the midfielder’s line as well as a 27.1 percentage point increase in the defensive performance of the team. By using the model referenced in the paper Maintaining Market Position: Team Performance, Revenue and Wage Expenditure in the English Premier League. The resulting team performance is expected to increase by 20.37 percentage points. This is worth the expensive salary increase due to the entire team being well within the initial budget of 995,000,000.

| Name        | Position             |  Salary      |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| K. Kazlo    | Forward              | 2, 370, 000  |
| H. Mubaiwa  | Forward              | 1, 580, 000  |
| F. Gan      | Midfielder           | 4, 380, 000  |
| G. Jankowski| Midfielder           | 9, 020, 000  |
| E. Ngoma    | Midfielder           | 1, 340, 000  |
| L. Lubega   | Midfielder & Foward  | 24, 740, 000 |
| Q.Sano      | Defender             | 7, 200, 000  |
| X. Nazari   | Defender & Forward   | 4, 160, 000  |
| K. Nalwang  | Defender & Midfielder| 23, 900, 000 |
| R. Namutebi | Defender             | 6, 380, 000  |
| U. Nyeko    | Goalkeeper           | 5, 600, 000  |


The players were selected and reassessed to identify and improve any area of improvement. After reassessing the whole team again, the historical performance of such players. The team was built to better understand their projected performance in the next five and ten years. Both projective performances and objectives were summarised in the objectives section above.
          
             
Economic Impact
======================

Establishing a qualifying competitive team within the international FSA league creates great economic benefits for Rarita. Although the winner of the FSA championship receives a monetary reward, due to its international platform participants also receive economic developments through increased global visibility and improved investment, tourism, and political opportunities. The implementation of a Rarita football team engenders augmented taxes, potential financial prizes that can be reinvested into the national economy (e.g., infrastructure, equipment), newly created job positions, increased salaries, tourism income and even implied benefits from improved education, reduced crime and enriched wellbeing, which all deliver a positive economic impact (Marcelin, 2019). 
 
It should be noted that although the short-term impact may be minimal, the long-term economic impact on multiple indices is more noticeable. This is attributable to novelty effects (Maennig, 2007) brought on through new stadiums, which as an investment generates ticket revenue, the feel-good effect in won games, which stimulates increased consumption and improved productivity and efficiency across all industries, and finally an enhanced national image, which facilitates increased international trade, foreign investment in Rarita, and future tourism. Evidently, these impacts will be most prominent in the tourism, entertainment, and accommodation industries and will be more pronounced in population dense provinces, in particular West Rarita and Central Rarita.

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Rarita’s historic GDP per capita over the past 10 years undergoes significant variability from ∂ 18,292 in 2011 to ∂ 23,863 in 2020. This represents a 3.05% average growth each year, however evidently other countries performing in all levels of competitive football, with similar GDP per capita (i.e., Galamily, Greri Landmoslands, Manlisgamncent, Nganion and Nkasland Cronestan), have a higher average growth rate of 3.738%. This 0.687% higher GDP per capita growth rate indicates the positive impact the FSA can have on Rarita’s GDP. Although, through the implementation plan, the short-term economic impact may not be pronounced, the long-term impact is still promising. The economic impact on Rarita’s GDP is also dependent on other factors such as the countries performance and whether the country hosts the games. In fact, since 1990 the winner of the Soccer World Cup has witnessed an

<p align="center">

  </p>
  
average increase of 1.6% in GDP over the previous years, followed by a small contraction in the year after (Sands, 2018). Thus, by employing a conservative 0.687% average growth increase, the following GDP per capita projection for Rarita is obtained. 
The above graph depicts the positive impact the FSA can have, whereby in actuality more variability will be witnessed. 
## Gross National Income (GNI)
Like Rarita’s GDP, its GNI per capita, which currently holds a historic average growth of 2.53% per year, will also witness a positive long-term impact characterised by year-on-year variability. This is largely attributable to the investment opportunities available through Rarita’s international visibility. 
## Spot Rates & Inflation Rates
Given that Rarita’s interest rates and inflation is largely dependent on its fiscal and monetary policies as well as the country's general economic condition, the implementation of a competitive team will have a nil or negligible impact. 
## Household Saving
Since consumption during game related events will increase, it is expected that savings would decrease. However, given that for domestic residents this expenditure will only switch during matches and may even be compensated with lower expenditure afterwards, the impact on household savings will be insignificant. As such the historic household savings average of 8.40% will most likely hold. 
## Healthcare spending
Rarita’s healthcare spending per capita has experienced a historic growth averaging 2.17% per year with higher expenditure in East Rarita. However, given that football is proven to promote inclusivity within communities, findings reveal that they foster positive mental health consequences, and public engagement brought on by it also improves physical health, reducing risks of diabetes and heart disease (Campelli, 2021). Thus, the positive health consequences can lead to reduced healthcare spending in the long-term and will be especially prominent in East Rarita. 
## Conversion Rates
The international visibility that entering the FSA offers, produces export and foreign investment opportunities, which can ultimately strengthen the Doubloon (∂) in the long run. Historic data reveals that the Doubloon has depreciated on average by 0.20% per year against the Euro, however through the implementation of a competitive team in the long run an appreciation can occur. 

Implementation Plan
======================

The team's total annual cost is 90, 670, 000 Doubloons. Assuming that the player’s salaries are paid on a weekly basis, and their wage increase and inflation is 3% p.a. This wage increase is presumed for two reasons. It is the average targeted inflation rate in many developed countries (Inflation Targeting reviewed by Robert CA. Kelly) [i] and it is approximately where the three year moving average of Rarita’s current inflation is. Also, assuming that the interest rate is on average 5.25% across the ten years. The total expected present value of the football team would cost 811,537,596.90 Doubloons. 
 
In our calculation, sources of revenue were assumed to be from matchday, broadcast and commercial. This included tickets sold, sponsors of the team, advertisements and fan merchandise. Sources of expenses included staff costs, travelling, accommodation, jerseys, training equipment, pitch maintenance, medical team and coaching staff.
The per capita total revenue and total expense was projected for 10 years until 2030 using the 3% inflation rate. Using the squads within Rarity’s nation leagues total revenue for 10 years was 5,896,105.38 Doubloons and total expense was 5,374,191.80 Doubloons (Exhibit F). Given the initial 995 million Doubloons allocation by the Rarita government and the 5.25% interest rate the expected present value of net proceeds in Doubloons was 183,775,282.92. Therefore, 18,377,528.29 Doubloons were reinvested back into the team annually for 10 years (Exhibit F). 
Reinvestment included:
 - stadium expansion
 - medical facilities
 - scouts and professionals
 - coaching
 - injury programmes

Key Assumptions
======================

## Player Position Metric Excluded
 - When building a model used for analysis, we assumed that goalkeepers do not have the role of shooting or scoring goals. Therefore the data used in the model was filtered such that the metrics of goal scorers was used to analyze suitable players for the team.
 - Similarly, the “score” metric used primary statistics for each role. For example, for midfielders passing statistics were the base for our “score” metric.
## Age Projections of Player’s Performance
 - When projecting future performance of players, it was found based on our “score” that with age, performance decreased. Hence this was incorporated into the model for future performance projections. The performance projection of the team is primarily based on how well each player is projected to improve with age as well as integrating the work from paper, Money Talks: Team Variables and Player Positions that Most Influence the Market Value of Professional Male Footballers in Europe.

Risk and Risk Mitigation Considerations
======================

## Qualitative Risks
### Injury Risk
 - Selecting players who get injured will reduce the competitiveness of the national soccer team, making it difficult for Rarita to perform well in the FSA
 - Older players have a higher risk of injury, so Rarita can restrict team selection beyond a certain age to minimise this risk. 
 - Some players may be more injury prone than others so it is important to perform thorough medical assessments.
 - An injury prevention program and specific protocols should be enforced to minimise injury risk
### Economic Risk
 - Low economic development and growth in Rarita will reduce global visibility of the national soccer team (decreased opportunities for investment and job creation)
 - Economic uncertainty will increase household savings across the country, meaning the household consumption and GDP will remain low. 
 - Appreciation of Doubloon against foreign currencies will steer away tourists due to their foreign currency being worth less (revenue will be less than projected)
 - Failure to qualify for the FSA will further reinforce economic risk as poor performances will stifle the growth of Rarita’s GDP (less interest, tourism and investment).
 - Economic risk can be monitored by looking at the national soccer team’s contribution to GDP and its growth per capita.
### Reputation Risk
Reputation risk will reduce revenue (ticket sales) and cause financial damage. However, it can be reduced by having adequate facilities, appropriate sponsors and well-behaved players.
#### Facilities
 - Stadium design and pitch maintenance that meets FSA quality guidelines
 - Adequate training equipment 
 - Injury safety practices
 - Limited facilities reduces the appeal of playing for Rarita, making team selection restricted and thus difficult for Rarity’s success in RSA
 - Investing in adequate facilities will reduce reputation risk
#### Sponsors
 - Sponsors need to follow ethical and behavioural practices
 - Selecting the wrong sponsors will damage Rarita’s reputation and discourage supporters, reducing ticket sales. It may cause other sponsors to also withdraw
 - Important to perform proper due diligence while selecting sponsors and to maximise revenue
#### Players
 - Risk of choosing players that have a criminal history that can damage Rarity’s reputation
 - Risk of player misconduct off the field
 - Risk can be mitigated by Including bonuses for good behaviour for players that previously caused misconduct
 - Avoid signing any players with criminal history/illegal activity
### Finance risk
 - Risk of insolvency if expenses are unable to be covered with revenues. 
 - Poor performance in the RSA will reduce the revenue generated and create finance risk. 
 - A strong performance means the team needs to be mindful of overspending, as revenue increases and expenses will also increase (player wages). 
 - The national soccer team needs to develop strategies to remain solvent and have prudential oversight to reduce financial damage.

Data and Data Limitations
======================

### Data Cleaning Anomalies

Within the player data document there were multiple cases of numbers that were peculiar. The dataset contained negative probabilities for many of the fields such as Goals. Exhibit A  is one example where it can be seen for the players that they have negative probabilities, therefore in order to increase the accuracy of the data these fields were voided. This applies to other parts of the document where other negative data fields were voided.
