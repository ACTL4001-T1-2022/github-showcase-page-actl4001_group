Executive Summary
======================

The report presents how we plan to help the Commissioner of Sport for Rarita build the national football team as well as provide detail to its competitiveness and positive impact on the economy. The team selection and implementation plan is set out by an Actuarial control and business cycle plan. The metrics used for assessment and the impact described in the economy are highlighted and continuously monitored the results to identify and define new problems uncovered in our analysis.

The report summarises the two team competitiveness objectives and thoroughly outlines the actuarial and business implementation plan used for the team and economic evaluation respectively. The assumptions and limitations that come from the judgement of the team selection and its impact on the economy are summarised to present the constraint and unresolved constraints. 


Objectives
======================

The aim of the report was to help the country of Rarita select a team of players who will build a brand for Rarita’s football program with the goal to achieve a positive economic impact. The Commissioner of Sport for Rarita aims the team to be competitive, meaning that both the team ranks in the top 10 within the next five years. As well as achieving a FSA championship within the next ten years both with a high probability. The two objectives were assessed in the report and are summarised below:

 - The following team is projected to have an average chance 85.32% of achieving in the top 10 of the tournament within the next five years. The team’s chance of achieving in the top ten is most likely to occur in year five of them being together, with a probability of 88.74%.
