Executive Summary
======================

The report presents how we plan to help the Commissioner of Sport for Rarita build the national football team as well as provide detail to its competitiveness and positive impact on the economy. The team selection and implementation plan is set out by an Actuarial control and business cycle plan. The metrics used for assessment and the impact described in the economy are highlighted and continuously monitored the results to identify and define new problems uncovered in our analysis.

The report summarises the two team competitiveness objectives and thoroughly outlines the actuarial and business implementation plan used for the team and economic evaluation respectively. The assumptions and limitations that come from the judgement of the team selection and its impact on the economy are summarised to present the constraint and unresolved constraints. 


Objectives
======================

The aim of the report was to help the country of Rarita select a team of players who will build a brand for Rarita’s football program with the goal to achieve a positive economic impact. The Commissioner of Sport for Rarita aims the team to be competitive, meaning that both the team ranks in the top 10 within the next five years. As well as achieving a FSA championship within the next ten years both with a high probability. The two objectives were assessed in the report and are summarised below:

 - The following team is projected to have an average chance 85.32% of achieving in the top 10 of the tournament within the next five years. The team’s chance of achieving in the top ten is most likely to occur in year five of them being together, with a probability of 88.74%.
 - The team also on 35.08% average have a probability of ever winning the championship in the next ten years. This estimate is mostly likely to occur in seven years times, which gives them a chance of 43.05% of occur with a standard deviation  3.46%.




Team Selection
======================

We derived a performance metric across all players using the historical data of 2020 and 2021 tournament results. This performance metric was a calculation using the weighted average of the team’s performance whilst also incorporating the effectiveness of each player’s position on the field. The overall model is constructed from the work, Money Talks: Team Variables and Player Positions that Most Influence the Market Value of Professional Male Footballers in Europe by six academics primarily from the University of Madrid: José Luis Felipe, Alvaro Fernandez-Luna and Pablo Burillo. The team selection was constructed on the foundation set in the paper but selecting each player by each position. The team constructed for the country of Rarita was modeled using a generalized linear model in order to understand the predictors which compose a strong player for each position .  The team formation is 4-4-2, meaning there will be four defenders, four midfielders and two forwards.
 
After the four generalized linear models are performed in best predicting our performance metric. The players I ranked from best to worst according to the player’s predicted score. It is clear from the figure below why the models agree that a player aged 20-25 is best to be selected due to their performance being at peak at around age 27. Moreover, the figure below shows that the salary and performance are not correlated, primarily due to the non-linear relationship between salary and score. Hence, it is financially efficient to select younger players who have salaries that are lower.

The graph above should be the red and blue lines for the 2020 and 2021 tournament performances. The performance for each position is predicted by incorporating the logistic linking function to maximize the person’s probability of achieving a championship.
Once the players are ranked according to the performance metric predicted. The salary for each player is too expensive for the 995,000,000 budgets. Hence, national Rarita players are considered more highly and reassessed under each player’s performance divided by their annual salary. Therefore, when considering the budget constraint, the models recommend selecting a Rarita player of much more worth since these players have a 74.32% lower salary on average but perform at 40.32% as well according to the developed scoring metric. Resulting, in the player being much more worth their salary. Once all the players are ranked there are only three selected  players who are not from Rarita. 
This is because after appropriately integrating their salary to adjust their ranking. A new problem was found that certain players are far too expensive for their worth.  This resulted in two midfielders and a defender to be replaced by player’s who are more worth their salary with respect to their replaced players.
The replaced players’ salaries are quite expensive with respect to the Rarita’s player respectively.. However, the replacement will lead to a 34.52 percentage point increase in the midfielder’s line as well as a 27.1 percentage point increase in the defensive performance of the team. By using the model referenced in the paper Maintaining Market Position: Team Performance, Revenue and Wage Expenditure in the English Premier League. The resulting team performance is expected to increase by 20.37 percentage points. This is worth the expensive salary increase due to the entire team being well within the initial budget of 995,000,000.
